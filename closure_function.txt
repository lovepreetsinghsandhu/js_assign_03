                                                       Closer Function
                                                       
Closer is a function which is defined inside the another function, has access not only to his variables but outer function’s variables
and global variables also. In other words closure is ‘function + scope’. Closure remembers its variables and variables of environment
in which it is created as well .
 
In the following example the whole closure function is described.

Function one(a)
 {
                  Var firstvalue=a

                     Return function(b)

                       {

                          Return firsstvalue*b

                       }

}

Var result1=new one (1)
Var result2=new one (2)

Console.log(result1(5)) //5
Console.log(result2(10)) //20

Explanation:- In this example we create a function named ‘one’, which is returning another function with access to its outer function’s
variables. Now inner function relies on the outer functions variable ‘a’ that lives in the context of the outer one function.
